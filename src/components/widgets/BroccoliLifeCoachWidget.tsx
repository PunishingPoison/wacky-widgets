    wisdom: "Growth happens even when you don't feel like it."
  },

    problem: "People don't appreciate me",
    advice: "Kid, I've been called 'little trees' by toddlers and 'gross' by teenagers for decades. But you know what? I'm still here, packed with vitamins and fiber. Your worth isn't determined by other people's taste buds.",
    wisdom: "You can't please everyone, but you can be nutritious anyway."
  },

    problem: "I'm struggling with change",
    advice: "You see these florets? Each one started as a tiny bud. Change is just growth in disguise. I went from a seed to this magnificent green crown. Embrace your transformation.",

  },
  {
    problem: "I feel like giving up",
    advice: "Look at me - I'm literally a vegetable that most kids hate, yet I persist. I show up on plates worldwide, bringing nutrition whether people want it or not. That's dedication, my friend.",
    wisdom: "Persistence is the secret ingredient to success."
  },
  {
    problem: "I'm worried about my health",
    advice: "I'm literally made of antioxidants, vitamin C, and fiber. Take care of your body like it's the only one you've got - because it is. Eat your vegetables, including me!",
    wisdom: "Your body is your temple, so don't feed it junk food."
  },
  {
    problem: "I'm having relationship issues",
    advice: "I get along great with cheese, but I'm also fine on my own. Good relationships should enhance your flavor, not mask it. Be yourself, and the right people will appreciate your natural taste.",
    wisdom: "The right people will love you for who you are, stems and all."
  },
  {
    problem: "I'm stressed about work",
    advice: "I spend my entire existence being steamed, boiled, and roasted, yet I maintain my nutritional integrity. Stress is just heat - it can make you stronger if you don't let it overcook you.",
    wisdom: "Pressure can make you tender, but don't let it make you mushy."
  },
  {
    problem: "I don't feel confident",
    advice: "I'm green, tree-shaped, and smell funny when cooked, yet I'm considered a superfood. Confidence isn't about being perfect - it's about knowing your value despite your quirks.",
    wisdom: "Your uniqueness is your superpower."
